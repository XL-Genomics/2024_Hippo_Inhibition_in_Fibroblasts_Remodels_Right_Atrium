## YAP induces a glycolytic microenvironment to promote cardiac fibrosis and inflammation

Cardiac fibrosis is common in most types of heart disease and occurs from excess extracellular matrix deposition by cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Loss of Hippo signaling in CFs activates the transcriptional co-activator YAP, which promotes fibrosis and inflammation. Here, we investigated how YAP in Hippo-deficient CFs reprograms metabolism and promotes CF-macrophage interactions. We found that CFs in human right atrial tissue have higher YAP activity and glycolysis than CFs in other heart chambers. Mouse genetic and metabolic studies, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling revealed that Hippo-deficient CFs activate glycolysis and increase cell plasticity as they differentiate into osteochondroprogenitors. Inhibiting glycolysis blocks Hippo-deficient CF-induced hyperplasia and fibrosis. Sequencing analysis and functional studies identified cell-cell communications between Hippo-deficient CFs and macrophages. Hippo-deficient CFs secrete colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) to promote macrophage expansion, whereas macrophages secrete insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) to promote Hippo-deficient CF proliferation and fibrosis. In summary, CF YAP defines the glycolytic microenvironment by enhancing the CF-macrophage cell circuit to drive fibrosis and inflammation.

The computational framework includes: 
1) Initial processing of sequencing data and QC.
2) Integration of single nucleus RNA seqeucning data and spatial transcriptomics data. Cell identity annotationa and visulization.
3) Explorative investigation and visualization of omics datasets.
